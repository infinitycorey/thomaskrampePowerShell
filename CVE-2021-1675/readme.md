# CVE-2021-1675 aka Print Nightmare Workaround
Just provide a text file with all your servers and run this script to prevent SYSTEM for adding malcious DLL's in your spool\drivers directory.

Run 
`TK_PrintNightMare -mode secure -Serverlist "C:\PathToYour\serverlist.txt"` 

to secure your Print Spooler, or

`TK_PrintNightMare -mode unsecure -Serverlist "C:\PathToYour\serverlist.txt"` 

to change it back to normal/unsecure

That's it, but keep in mind that's only a workaround until a patch is available.
